# Welcome to Burp-to-SQLMap

As you know, SQL Injection is a security vulnerability with critical severity. If you are a hacker you know it as well that it takes a lot of times to find a sql injection vulnerability on a target. It will be worse if you are a penetration tester. You must check this vulnerability on all of  target URLs by intercepting packets using Burp Suit or other tools and in big Portals it’s not easy.

I have good news for hackers and pen testers. I made it easier by my new python script. The only thing you should do, is exporting your packets as a burp suit state file. The rest of steps will done by my script. I called me script “Burp-TO-SQLMap” and I will explain the test process from the beginning.
